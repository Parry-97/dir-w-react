# Repository of solutions the "Directory with React" Manning LiveProject

Using _React_, _React Router_, and the _Chakra UI_ design system, I've built an employee directory along with the user interface and add search functionality to employee pages in the directory. To improve the user experience, I've also implemented badges that let employees celebrate each others' achievements and create visually appealing indicators that show the status of data retrieval from the server using _React Query_ tools. Tests have also been written to make sure the app works as expected.

The Live Project Series is divided into 5 projects, which are listed below and separated each in its own individual folder:

- _Implement Employee Search_
- _Display React Query States_
- _Query Mutations_
- _Write Automated Tests_
